# Third-party-APIs-This is a code for creating a Workday Scheduler. This is a calender for scheduling my daily work. This has been done using APIs. I have attached some print screen images to show the actual calender.

The calender has been made in such a way that it will show the current date. Moreover the calender will show usual office hours in the UK which is 9.00am till 5.00pm.
